# basics.test.ts Progress Tracking

## Current Status: 66/67 tests passing (98.5%)

## Failing Tests

### 1. ✅ should handle localization with optional fields
**Fixed!** The solution was to implement recursive search in `findBestMatchRecursive` that checks nested arrays regardless of their completion state. The parser was creating deeply nested structures and the schema-aware layer needed to search through all levels to find the correct array.

### 2. ✅ should handle complex nested object with triple quotes  
**Fixed!** The solution was to make the core parser continue trying all strategies (markdown, findAllJSONObjects, etc.) when multiple sources exist, but only for cases where we have both markdown and JSON objects. This allows the parser to find JSON objects with triple quotes that come after markdown blocks.

### 3. ❌ should handle complex malformed JSON sequence
**Error**:
```
ZodError: [
  {
    "code": "invalid_type",
    "expected": "object",
    "received": "string",
    "path": [],
    "message": "Expected object, received string"
  }
]
```

**Analysis**: The parser is returning a string instead of the expected object structure. This is a complex test with heavily malformed JSON that has missing commas and improper nesting.

## Tasks

- [x] Debug test 1: Analyze why the parser returns malformed array structure
- [x] Fix test 1: Implement recursive search in valueToPlainObject for nested results
- [x] Debug test 2: Found that JSON with triple quotes is not being parsed
- [x] Fix test 2: Make core parser try all strategies when multiple sources exist
- [x] Fix regressions: Reverted overly aggressive changes to string handling
- [ ] Debug test 3: Fix complex malformed JSON parsing
- [ ] Compare each failing case with Rust implementation
- [ ] Run tests after each fix to ensure no regressions

## Notes

The key learnings from this session:
1. The recursive search through nested arrays was essential for handling complex multi-result structures
2. The core parser needs to try all strategies when there are multiple potential sources (markdown + JSON)
3. Being too aggressive with string schema handling can break other tests
4. The Rust implementation's behavior needs to be carefully matched, especially around `any_of` and simplify logic

For test 3, the issue appears to be with extremely malformed JSON that needs the iterative parser's recovery capabilities.
