# Research: Rust Union Type Resolution Architecture Analysis

**Date**: 2025-07-24T04:21:13+0000
**Researcher**: Claude Code
**Git Commit**: 4c7a06c47cee073607f39bde051cb68f12a6b1b4
**Branch**: master
**Repository**: jsonish

## Research Question

How does the Rust JSONish parser implement intelligent union type resolution capabilities including discriminated union handling, validation-based type selection, scoring algorithms, ambiguity resolution, and fallback mechanisms for complex scenarios involving multiple possible type interpretations?

## Summary

The Rust JSONish parser implements union type resolution through a sophisticated multi-layered scoring-based architecture that evaluates all union members simultaneously and selects the best match using quantitative scoring, discriminated union detection, validation-based selection, and progressive fallback strategies. The system achieves intelligent type resolution by combining structural analysis, enum discrimination with alias support, constraint validation integration, and comprehensive error recovery mechanisms optimized for real-world LLM output scenarios.

## Detailed Findings

### Core Union Type Resolution Architecture

**Scoring-Based Selection System** (`src/deserializer/coercer/coerce_union.rs:7-32`)
- Union resolution uses parallel evaluation of all union options rather than sequential testing
- Main entry point `coerce_union()` extracts union options from `TypeIR::Union(options, _)` structure
- Each union member is coerced independently using `options.iter_include_null().iter().map()`
- Final selection delegated to `array_helper::pick_best()` for sophisticated scoring-based choice

**Advanced Type Selection Algorithm** (`src/deserializer/coercer/array_helper.rs:26-265`)
- `pick_best` function implements comprehensive union member prioritization logic
- Failed coercions receive maximum penalty score (`i32::MAX`) while successful ones use computed scores
- Multi-stage prioritization considers list type preferences, object type discrimination, and composite vs primitive preferences
- Advanced tiebreaker logic with default value deprioritization and string coercion penalties

**Union Type Structure and Processing** (`baml-types/src/ir_type/mod.rs:53-56, 297-303`)
- Union types defined as `UnionTypeGeneric<T>` with separate `types` vector and `null_type` handling
- `iter_include_null()` provides all union options including null for optional unions
- `iter_skip_null()` returns only non-null options for strict union resolution
- Optional union detection through `is_optional()` method for conditional null handling

### Union Scoring System and Type Selection Algorithms

**Flag-Based Scoring Architecture** (`src/deserializer/score.rs:34-77`)
- "Lower is better" scoring system where problematic coercions receive higher penalty scores
- `Flag::UnionMatch`: 0 points (no penalty for successful union selection)
- Medium penalties (2-3 points): `Flag::SubstringMatch`, `Flag::ImpliedKey`, `Flag::ObjectToString`
- High penalties (100+ points): `Flag::DefaultFromNoValue`, `Flag::DefaultButHadValue`

**Advanced Selection Prioritization Logic** (`src/deserializer/coercer/array_helper.rs:133-161`)
- String coercion avoidance for unions: deprioritizes single-property objects with `ImpliedKey` flags
- Default value deprioritization: objects with all default values ranked lower than parsed content
- Composite vs primitive priority: JSON-to-string conversions penalized against native primitive types
- Score-based primary selection maps successful coercions to `(index, score)` pairs for comparison

**String Priority Implementation** (`src/deserializer/coercer/coerce_primitive.rs:214-222`)
- Float coercion from strings like "1 cup unsalted butter" receives `Flag::StringToFloat` penalty
- String vs number ambiguity resolved by preferring string interpretation in `string | float` unions
- Multi-stage string matching with exact, punctuation-stripped, and case-insensitive fallbacks
- Content analysis considers full context rather than just leading numeric characters

### Discriminated Union Handling Architecture

**Enum-Based Discrimination System** (`src/deserializer/coercer/ir_ref/coerce_enum.rs:14-31`)
- Comprehensive alias support through `enum_match_candidates` function with multiple matching strategies
- Real name matching, rendered name matching, and description-based matching for flexible discrimination
- Compound matching combines enum names and descriptions for robust fuzzy matching
- Test coverage includes financial UI systems with complex discriminator types (ETFAssistantAPI, StockAssistantAPI)

**Multi-Stage String Matching** (`src/deserializer/coercer/match_string.rs:131-220`)
- Four-stage matching: exact match → case-sensitive substring → punctuation-stripped → case-insensitive
- Overlap resolution filters conflicting matches while preferring longer substring matches
- Variant counting with occurrence-based scoring for ambiguous discriminator resolution
- Advanced tiebreaker logic handles multiple candidates through `Flag::StrMatchOneFromMany`

**Property-Based Discrimination Logic** (`src/deserializer/coercer/ir_ref/coerce_class.rs:21-381`)
- Sophisticated field matching strategy with rendered name trimming and scope management
- Implied key logic for single-field classes attempts whole-object coercion into target field
- Required vs optional field satisfaction scoring with extra key penalties for structural mismatches
- Multi-level discrimination through property presence analysis and type compatibility assessment

**Complex Discriminator Pattern Support**
- Action-based discrimination with alias mapping: `"RespondToUserAPI"` → `"RESPOND_TO_USER"`
- Multi-field discrimination considering enum variants, type compatibility, and optional field handling
- Hierarchical discrimination with nested union types and recursive type resolution
- Integration with scoring system maintains consistent prioritization across discriminator strategies

### Validation-Based Union Selection Architecture

**Schema Constraint Integration** (`src/deserializer/coercer/field_type.rs:106-125`)
- Constraint validation integrated into union resolution through `run_user_checks` evaluation
- Constraint results stored in `Flag::ConstraintResults` but don't directly penalize union selection
- Assert failures cause immediate rejection while check failures are recorded for debugging
- Post-coercion validation ensures selected union members satisfy all applicable constraints

**Format-Specific Validation Patterns**
- Email and phone number validation through regex patterns in constraint system
- Multi-stage validation: parse attempt → constraint evaluation → assert validation → score calculation
- Format-specific features include regex pattern matching, string similarity, punctuation normalization
- Substring frequency analysis provides count-based disambiguation for ambiguous cases

**Validation Scoring Integration** (`src/deserializer/score.rs:71`)
- Constraint results receive neutral scoring: `Flag::ConstraintResults(_) => 0`
- Validation doesn't directly influence union member scoring but affects final type acceptance
- Primary selection based on structural compatibility and type coercion quality
- Secondary consideration for constraint satisfaction in final validation stage

### Real-World Union Test Coverage and Scenarios

**Complex Discriminated Union Tests** (`src/tests/test_unions.rs:117-133, 240-275`)
- Multi-level discrimination with `CatAPicker`, `CatBPicker`, `CatCPicker` classes using different enum variants
- Action-based discrimination with API response structures and complex nested object validation
- Financial UI system testing with discriminator types: ETF, Stock, AskClarification, RespondToUser
- Blog system architecture testing with server actions, UI components, and application pages

**Validation-Based Selection Scenarios** (`src/tests/test_unions.rs:312-340`)
- Phone number vs email discrimination using regex validation patterns
- Contact information union resolution with format-specific constraint checking
- String vs numeric preference testing: "1 cup unsalted butter" prioritizes string over number
- Mixed content extraction scenarios with JSON embedded in markdown code blocks

**Edge Case and Error Recovery Testing**
- Malformed input handling with graceful degradation and best-effort resolution
- Empty data scenarios with null/undefined value handling in union contexts
- Streaming partial data with discriminator fields arriving late in processing streams
- Ambiguous input cases with multiple potential matches resolved through scoring system

**Performance and Integration Testing** (`benches/unions.rs`, `benches/partials.rs`)
- Statistical validation across 5 benchmark categories: literals, lists, classes, unions, partials
- Union resolution performance comparison and memory efficiency validation
- Integration with BAML's unified type system across language bindings
- Cross-language consistency testing through compressed schema definitions

## Parser Flow

**Union Type Resolution Pipeline**:
1. Raw LLM output → union coercion entry point with parallel evaluation strategy
2. Union options → `iter_include_null()/.iter()` → simultaneous coercion attempts for all members
3. Coercion results → individual scoring with flag-based penalty system
4. Score comparison → `pick_best()` algorithm with advanced prioritization logic
5. Type selection → sophisticated tiebreaker rules and fallback mechanisms
6. Validation integration → constraint checking and format-specific validation
7. Result assembly → selected union member with complete flag and score metadata
8. Error recovery → graceful degradation for malformed input with best-effort matching
