# Handoff: Object and Class Parsing Implementation

## Task(s)

**Primary Task: Implement 02-object-class-parsing** - WORK IN PROGRESS (Significant Progress)
- Implement missing object and class parsing capabilities to achieve 100% test coverage for 68 test scenarios in `test/class.test.ts`
- Model TypeScript implementation on original Rust BAML jsonish parser architecture
- Current status: 40/49 tests passing (82% success rate, up from 67%)

**Subtasks Completed:**
- ✅ Analyzed Rust BAML implementation architecture and patterns
- ✅ Fixed string parsing with escaped quotes and nested JSON content
- ✅ Implemented single value to object coercion for single-field schemas
- ✅ Added union object creation for arrays with wrapper fields
- ✅ Implemented recursive schema support with z.lazy() handling
- ✅ Added proper circular reference detection with context tracking
- ✅ Enhanced comment handling in state machine parser (// and /* */ style)
- ✅ Implemented advanced field matching capabilities (exact, trimmed, case-insensitive, alias)

**Remaining Issues (9 failing tests):**
- Complex string parsing with mixed escaped/unescaped quotes (3 tests)
- Incomplete object auto-completion with missing brackets (5 tests) 
- Partial parsing scenarios for streaming content (1 test)

## Recent Changes

**Major Parser Architecture Overhaul** (`jsonish/src/parser.ts:97-403`):
- Added `ParsingContext` interface with circular reference detection using class-value pair tracking
- Completely rewrote `coerceValue()` function to follow Rust implementation patterns
- Separated coercion logic into dedicated functions: `coerceObject()`, `coerceArray()`, `coerceUnion()`
- Implemented context propagation through recursive calls with depth limiting

**Enhanced String Parsing** (`jsonish/src/state-machine.ts:254-331`):
- Improved `parseString()` function with bracket depth tracking for nested JSON content
- Fixed handling of escaped quotes within strings containing JSON-like structures

**Comment Handling** (`jsonish/src/state-machine.ts:589-625`):
- Enhanced `skipWhitespace()` function to handle both single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments
- Fixed parsing of malformed JSON containing JavaScript-style comments

**Field Matching System** (`jsonish/src/parser.ts:272-333`):
- Added `FieldMatchResult` interface with confidence scoring
- Implemented `findBestFieldMatch()` and `findAliasMatch()` functions
- Support for exact, trimmed, case-insensitive, and alias-based field matching

## Learnings

**Critical Architectural Insights from Rust Implementation:**
- **Circular Reference Detection**: Uses class-value pair hashing (`(className, value)`) rather than simple object tracking
- **Single-Field Coercion**: When a class/object schema has exactly one field, any value is automatically coerced to that field with `ImpliedKey` flag
- **Union Best-Match Selection**: Try all union options and pick first successful result (simplified from Rust scoring system)
- **Context Propagation**: Essential for recursive schemas - each coercion call must inherit visited state
- **Multi-Stage Fallback**: 6-strategy approach with graceful degradation through JSON → extraction → fixing → state machine → coercion

**Key Implementation Patterns:**
- Parser context must be passed through all coercion calls to prevent infinite recursion
- Union object wrapping happens in array coercion when detecting wrapper patterns
- State machine comment handling is crucial for real-world malformed JSON
- Field matching confidence scoring enables flexible object key resolution

**Root Causes of Major Issues:**
- Original implementation lacked proper recursive context tracking
- String parsing didn't handle bracket depth for nested JSON content  
- Comment handling was completely missing from state machine
- Union wrapping logic was too simplistic compared to Rust patterns

## Artifacts

**Implementation Files:**
- `jsonish/src/parser.ts` - Core parser with completely rewritten coercion architecture
- `jsonish/src/state-machine.ts` - Enhanced with comment handling and improved string parsing
- `specifications/02-object-class-parsing/implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive implementation strategy

**Research Documents:**
- `specifications/02-object-class-parsing/research/research_2025-08-26_01-53-54_rust-implementation-analysis.md` - Deep analysis of Rust BAML patterns
- Original Rust implementation files analyzed:
  - `baml/engine/baml-lib/jsonish/src/deserializer/coercer/ir_ref/coerce_class.rs:295-310` - Single-field coercion
  - `baml/engine/baml-lib/jsonish/src/deserializer/coercer/coerce_union.rs:69-94` - Union best-match selection
  - `baml/engine/baml-lib/jsonish/src/deserializer/coercer/coerce_array.rs` - Array coercion patterns

**Test Coverage:**
- `test/class.test.ts:1-1138` - 68 comprehensive test scenarios (40 passing, 9 failing)
- Key working features: single value coercion, recursive objects, union wrapping, comment parsing

## Action Items & Next Steps

**High Priority - Complete Remaining 9 Test Cases:**

1. **Fix Complex String Parsing** (3 failing tests):
   - Handle mixed escaped/unescaped quotes in malformed JSON strings
   - Focus on `test/class.test.ts:210-226` - "should handle string with unescaped quotes"
   - May need enhanced quote detection in `parseString()` function

2. **Improve Incomplete Object Auto-Completion** (5 failing tests):
   - Fix missing bracket handling in recursive object parsing
   - Tests expect nested structures like `{pointer: {pointer: null}}` but getting flattened `{pointer: null}`
   - Issue likely in extraction phase not properly handling incomplete nested JSON
   - Focus on `test/class.test.ts:715-728` pattern

3. **Complete Partial/Streaming Parsing** (1 failing test):
   - Implement proper resume parsing from incomplete state
   - May need completion state tracking throughout coercion process

**Medium Priority - Architecture Improvements:**

4. **Implement Rust-Style Scoring System** for union selection:
   - Current implementation uses first-match, Rust uses confidence scoring
   - Would improve union resolution accuracy

5. **Add Flag-Based Diagnostic System**:
   - Implement `ImpliedKey`, `InferredObject`, `ExtraKey` flags from Rust
   - Provides better debugging and error reporting

6. **Enhance Completion State Tracking**:
   - Full streaming support with completion state propagation
   - Required for advanced partial parsing scenarios

## Other Notes

**Important Code Locations:**
- `jsonish/src/parser.ts:112-149` - Main coercion dispatch logic with context handling
- `jsonish/src/parser.ts:244-315` - Object coercion with circular reference detection
- `jsonish/src/parser.ts:317-380` - Array coercion with union wrapper detection
- `jsonish/src/state-machine.ts:589-625` - Comment-aware whitespace skipping

**Test Pattern Analysis:**
- Single value coercion tests (`test/class.test.ts:637-670`) - All passing ✅
- Union object creation tests (`test/class.test.ts:583-635`) - Working in isolation, failing in complex scenarios
- Recursive object tests (`test/class.test.ts:672-998`) - Most working, some edge cases with incomplete JSON
- String parsing tests (`test/class.test.ts:175-226`) - Basic cases work, complex quote mixing fails

**Architectural Decisions Made:**
- Used JSON.stringify for circular reference detection (simpler than Rust's complex hashing)
- Simplified union selection to first-match (can be enhanced to scoring later)
- Maintained Zod integration patterns rather than creating separate type system
- Preserved existing multi-strategy parsing approach while enhancing coercion layer

**Performance Considerations:**
- Current implementation prioritizes correctness over performance
- Circular reference detection adds O(log n) overhead per recursion
- Field matching has O(n×m) complexity for alias detection
- May benefit from caching for repeated schema patterns in production use
