# Feature: Streaming/Incremental JSON Parsing

## Overview
This feature provides comprehensive support for parsing incomplete, partial, and streaming JSON data in real-time scenarios. It enables the JSONish parser to handle JSON that arrives incrementally over time, maintains parsing state across partial updates, and provides intelligent completion tracking for streaming applications. The system supports progressive data processing with state management, graceful handling of incomplete structures, and performance optimization for large streaming datasets.

## Relationship to Parent Requirements
This feature implements several key sections from `specifications/requirements.md`:

- **Advanced Features** (Section 4.1.4): Streaming support and partial completion tracking
- **Core Parsing Engine** (Section 4.1.1): Multi-strategy parser with completion tracking
- **Schema Integration** (Section 4.1.2): Type coercion system for partial data structures
- **Error Handling & Reliability** (Section 4.2.2): Graceful degradation for incomplete data
- **Performance** (Section 4.2.1): Memory efficiency for large streaming structures
- **Error Recovery Strategy** (Section 5.2): State machine approach for partial data handling

## Test-Driven Specifications
Based on test file: `test/streaming.test.ts`

### Core Capabilities Tested

#### Basic Streaming Support
- **Incomplete Array Parsing**: Handle arrays with missing closing brackets (`[1,2` → `[1]`)
- **State Tracking**: Automatic state management with `Incomplete`, `Complete`, and `Pending` states
- **Partial Object Handling**: Process objects with missing fields or incomplete values
- **Progressive Updates**: Maintain consistency across incremental data updates

#### Stream Control Directives
- **@stream.done Behavior**: Strict validation requiring complete objects at boundaries
- **@stream.not_null Handling**: Validation of non-null constraints in streaming contexts
- **Nested Stream Controls**: Hierarchical application of streaming rules to nested structures
- **State Propagation**: Proper state inheritance through object hierarchies

#### Advanced Streaming Scenarios
- **Union Type Streaming**: Intelligent type resolution for incomplete union data
- **Tool-based Streaming**: Support for structured tool/command streaming with type discrimination
- **Large Memory Tests**: Performance validation with complex nested structures and unions
- **Progressive State Management**: Dynamic state transitions based on data completeness

### Key Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Incomplete Array Streaming**
   - Input: `{'nums': [1,2` (incomplete array)
   - Expected: `{nums: [1]}` (partial array with available elements)
   - State: Automatic detection of incomplete structure

2. **State-Aware Streaming Objects**
   - Streaming objects with explicit state fields (`value`, `state`)
   - States: `"Incomplete"`, `"Complete"`, `"Pending"`
   - Automatic state assignment based on data completeness

3. **Stream Done Validation**
   - `@stream.done` requires structurally complete objects
   - Failure on incomplete objects: `{'nums': [1,2]` (missing closing brace)
   - Success on nested completion: Partial arrays within complete objects

4. **Stream Not Null Constraints**
   - `@stream.not_null` fields must have non-null values
   - Graceful handling of null values in streaming contexts
   - Proper validation of required field presence

5. **Union Type Streaming Resolution**
   - Type discrimination for incomplete union data
   - Progressive type resolution as more data becomes available
   - Tool-based streaming with `type` field discrimination

6. **Large Scale Streaming Performance**
   - Complex nested objects with multiple union types
   - Arrays of heterogeneous objects in streaming contexts
   - Memory efficiency for large streaming datasets

### Advanced Streaming Features

#### Progressive State Management
- **State Transitions**: `Pending` → `Incomplete` → `Complete`
- **Field-Level States**: Individual field completion tracking
- **Hierarchical States**: Parent-child state relationships
- **State Validation**: Consistency checks across related fields

#### Streaming Array Handling
- **Partial Element Processing**: Handle incomplete array elements gracefully
- **Nested Array Support**: Multi-dimensional arrays with partial completion
- **Element State Tracking**: Per-element completion status
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient handling of large streaming arrays

#### Error Recovery in Streaming
- **Malformed Stream Handling**: Graceful processing of corrupted streaming data
- **Deep Nesting Support**: Robust handling of deeply nested partial structures
- **Incomplete String Handling**: Special processing for partial string values
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain parsing context across stream interruptions

### Edge Cases Covered

#### Incomplete Data Structures
- **Partial Arrays**: `[1, 2, 3` → `[1, 2]` (last incomplete element dropped)
- **Incomplete Objects**: `{"a": 1, "b":` → `{"a": 1}` (incomplete field omitted)
- **Nested Incompleteness**: Deep structures with multiple incomplete levels
- **String Truncation**: `{"field": "partial str` → proper string handling

#### Stream Control Edge Cases
- **Mixed Stream Directives**: Combination of `@stream.done` and `@stream.not_null`
- **Contradictory States**: Resolution of conflicting stream control requirements
- **Boundary Conditions**: Stream controls at object/array boundaries
- **Inheritance Rules**: Stream directive propagation through nested structures

#### Performance Edge Cases
- **Large Object Streaming**: Memory efficiency with massive streaming objects
- **Deep Nesting**: Performance with deeply nested streaming structures
- **Union Resolution**: Efficient type resolution in streaming union contexts
- **State Management**: Scalable state tracking for complex object hierarchies

### Expected Behavior

#### Stream Processing Rules
1. **Partial Completion Strategy**: Process available complete elements, defer incomplete ones
2. **State Assignment Logic**: Automatic state detection based on structural completeness
3. **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large streaming datasets
4. **Error Boundary**: Graceful degradation without data loss

#### State Management System
1. **State Lifecycle**: Clear transitions between Pending → Incomplete → Complete
2. **Field-Level Tracking**: Individual field completion status
3. **Validation Integration**: State-aware schema validation
4. **Consistency Guarantees**: Maintain data consistency across partial updates

#### Performance Characteristics
1. **Incremental Processing**: Process data as it becomes available
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize memory usage for large streams
3. **State Persistence**: Efficient state storage and retrieval
4. **Scalability**: Handle high-volume streaming scenarios
